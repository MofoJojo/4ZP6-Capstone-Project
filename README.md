Project: ARV Regimen Generator

17 HIV Antiretroviral (ARV) medications have been approved for use in children. This results in various regimens available for use, as usually most children need to be on 3 medications at once. There are many factors to consider when initiating ARVs in children as many medications have different toxicities and side effects (including affecting growth, hormones, kidneys etc). Also, certain viruses may be resistant to some medications and not others. Some medications will interact with other HIV or non HIV medications. Some medications come in liquids, dissolvable tablets, or pills which can affect what age children can take them or not. Also, FDA approval for certain medications depends on: age, weight etc. Drug insurance will only cover some medications. Therefore, it is very challenging to decide on a regimen given the multiple permutations.
